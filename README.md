# example-repo

This is an example of cloning a repo + using git with it

NEVER CLONE A REPO INTO A REPO

- git clone repo url 

- modify the file -> made sure we saved

- git add -A -> added the change files to the staging area

- git commit -m "meaninful message about to commit" - update our local with the changes

- git push origin main ->
- origin -> remote -> github
- main -> current branch working on

- git status -> check staging and committed

--

# Branching 

- git branch -a -> see all of the branches

Creating Branch

- git checkout -b name-of-branch -> create a new branch from the main & and moved us onto that branch

Navigating Branches

- git checkout name-of-branch -> moved us onto it

Pushing A Branch 

- git push origin name-of-branch -> push branch to remote 
- origin -> remote -> github
- name-of-branch -> branch with the changes we want to add
